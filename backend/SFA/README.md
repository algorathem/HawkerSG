# Query Directory

This script (`query_directory.py`) lets you quickly **search hawker centre stall data** by either:
- **Postal code**, or
- **Hawker centre name**.

It uses the `index.json` (built by `build_index.py`) to locate the correct CSV/XLSX file of stalls.

---

## How to Run
From the `backend` folder:
```bash
python query_directory.py
```
You'll be prompted: 
Enter postal code or hawker centre name:

If there is one match ‚Üí it will show how many stalls were found, plus the first 10 as a preview.

If there are multiple matches (e.g. typing "Jurong") ‚Üí it will ask you to choose which hawker centre.

If there are no matches ‚Üí it will tell you nothing was found.


Enter postal code or hawker centre name: jurong
‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple matches found:
1. Jurong West 505 (640505)
2. Jurong East 347 (600347)

Select a number: 1
‚úÖ Found 42 stalls in Jurong West 505 (640505)
- Ah Hock Chicken Rice
- ...

üëâ Use this script whenever you want to look up stalls by postal code/centre name without digging into the CSV files manually.
